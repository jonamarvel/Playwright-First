Objective: Get eveeryone with Playwright Typescript in UI and API Automation (Salesforce)

2 End to End Scenario: (CRUD)

#1) Create Dashboard through UI + Verify the data is created using API by editing and deleting those records !!
#2) Create test data using leads API + Search, Update and delete the same lead record 

Inputs:

1) Steps to perform an action (UI)
2) API Documentation (Spec / Contract)

Best Practices:

1) Understand the scenario (Manually Test - Browser + PostMan)
2) Locators (UI) : id, css (relative locators) / xpath
3) Actions (fill, click, ...)
4) a) End point b) Headers c) Body Paramters d) Send request (Get/Post/Delete) e) Verify the response
5) Verify response
   a) status code (200 / 201 / 204) .. 
   b) time (assert the response time within 2 seconds)
   c) validate the response structure (specific key)
   d) store them in your constants 
6) Start building the tests (functions - createDashboard, updateDashboardApi, deleteDashboardApi)
7) Test them in debug mode (in playwright with inspector) for a single data
8) Run them for different data / browser 
9) Document those learnings for your reference

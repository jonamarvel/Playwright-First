# Test Scenario (Sequence of real-time user behavior of Salesforce) 

1. Create a Lead in Salesforce and convert into Opportunity.

2. Create a Chatter and linking the Lead, Contact, Account.


Inputs:

1) Test Scenario - Steps document (with clear action and expected result)
2) Capture video to supplement the document steps


Best Practices :
1. Always manually excute the given test scenario before doing anything and confirm that you understand functionality.

2. While you understand the functionality also document the best selectors/locators.
    a)id(#id)
    b) name ([name = 'value])
    c) class([.class]) //unique, multiple occurance --> If it is 1 or 2 --> first()
/nth()
    d)  attribute([attr='value]) // unique
    e) css selector / xpath

dont know -> write down and reach out

3. While you manually navigate -> write down the methods (fill, click)

4. Start developing your test scripts in VS code
    a) Proper comment(copy the test step)
    b) Proper naming convention for your logs and variable naming conventions
    c) Try to avoid using sleep / setTimeout(ask for help - if the code is not working)
    d) do not code everything at once. stop and execute every five or six steps

5. Debugging your testscript
    a) run the test script in debug mode (npx playwright test filename.spec.ts --debug)
    b) user step over function to navigate to every line of code
    c) if anything fails, understand the error message and then debug yourself
    d) ask your mentor for help

6. Continut to code the next 5-6 steps and continue to debug
7. Once all looks good, just run them on different browsers.
8. Whenever you learning something new(from mistakes), document those and share it!
